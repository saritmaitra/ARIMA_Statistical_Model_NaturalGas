# ARIMA_Timeseries_Stochastic
ARIMA class model is widely used approach for time-series prediction. ARIMA stands for auto regressive integrated moving averages and popular for time-series prediction. 

We have a univariate daily time series data and our use case here is to forecast future time steps using the univariate data. The time series is stochastic/ random walk price series.
